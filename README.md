# chonky

**Fixes chonky's name**

This mod is also a proof of concept, showing how to easily edit a character's attributes. In this case, we're loading the character data (tres) file, but you can load any other file. See mod_main.gd for the code, look in the `_ready()` func.

For example, to edit Chunky's "increase MaxHP modifications" stat, load the file "chunky_effect_2.tres", and edit either the [i]key[/i] or the [i]value[/i].
